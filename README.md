# Data Sience Laboratory

In this folder save every step of my workprocess. Minimal Work Effort is contained here.

## Data structure:  
- EDA: Stands for Explorational Data Analysis. It's reason to understand the data
- src: Sorce for python codes and notebooks. For data preparation, model creation, etc.
- figures: Inside this repo, the figures are saved.
- results: Inside this repo, the results are saved, for example: models, model parameters.
- data: In this repo, the data is saved, if it is too big, it will contain link for the container or some description of the data, I dunno yet.

## Project name:
Eddies

## How to use it:
### Step 1
First you have to create an enviroment. If you are using anaconda, it is the following command:  
<center> conda env create -f environment.yml </center>  
Note: you have to go into the dependecies folder, but after it, this will work  
In the kooplex you need to consult with the teachers.

### Step 2
(Optional for users)  
Understanding the data. Go into the EDA folder. There are 2 notebooks, which were used to understand the data. It is mandatory for later work.

### Step 3
Feature engineering

### Step 4 
Baseline model creation

### Step 5 
Fine tuning
